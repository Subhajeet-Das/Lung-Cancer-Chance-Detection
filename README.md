## <p align="justify">With the increase in amount of air polution around us, the chances of Lung Cancer is increasing exponentially. This brings into account proper diagnostic and thorough checkup. Here, we are detecting the chances of Lung Cancer (i.e., *High*, *Medium* or *Low*) based on parameters like- Air Polution level, Dust allergy, Occupational Hazards, Smoking etc. using Random Forest, ADABoost Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier. The accuracy gathered are 100%, 70.33%, 100%, 100%, 98.67%, 100% & 99% respectively. But Doctor's observation & decision shall be treated as final.</p>
